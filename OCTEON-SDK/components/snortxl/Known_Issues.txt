SnortXL Known Issues
====================

1.  This release supports only OCTEON 70XX EVB/SFF device.
2.  SnortXL on Linux in SE-UM mode is supported in this build. SE mode is not 
    supported.
3.  PCAP, OCTEON and AFPACKET data acquistion modules (DAQ) are supported in 
    this release. DAQ AFPACKET works with OCTEON Ethernet module and supports 
    inline mode of operation; however this is an experimental feature and has 
    not been verified.
4.  SnortXL using OCTEON DAQ can not co-exist with OCTEON ethernet module.
5.  SnortXL using OCTEON DAQ should be run on a power of 2 number of cores for
    hardware flow pinning to work.
6.  SnortXL using AFPACKET DAQ can be run only on a single core. However for
    better performance, Linux should be booted with multiple cores and SnortXL
    should be scheduled to run on any one core.
7.  Multiple runs of SnortXL on Linux maybe unstable and thus not recommended.
8.  This build has been tested with the bundled snort configurations and rules
    only. Refer to the configuration file for verified preprocessor options.

    folder. This build has been verified with these compile options only.
