Overview
--------
Due to contract terms with some 3rd party research organizations, 
a number of VRT certified rules will only be delivered as binaries.

This applies only to shared object (SO) rules. Non-shared object rules
WILL NOT be affected. Additionally, because of this change and to better
serve the Snort community the VRT will pre-compile the "SO" rules so
they are easier to use on the various platforms utilized by the snort
community and the VRT subscribers.

Directory Structure
-------------------
The structure of the "so_rules" directory inside the rule is as follows:

so_rules/
	src/
	precompiled/
               <distro>/
                        <platform>/
                                   <snort-version>

Where:
<distro> is one of the following values:
  a. CentOS-4.6
  b. CentOS-5.0
  c. FC-5
  d. FC-9
  e. ubuntu-6.01.1
  f. ubuntu-8.04
  g. Debian Lenny
  h. FreeBSD 7.0
  i. RHEL-5.0

<platform> is one of the following values:
  a. i386 (EXCEPT for Ubuntu-8.04 and RHEL-5.0)
  b. x86-64 (ONLY for CentOS-5.0, FC-9, Ubuntu-8.04 and RHEL-5.0)

<snort-version> is one of the following values
  a. 2.7.0
  b. 2.8.0.1
  c. 2.8.0.2
  d. 2.8.1
  e. 2.8.2
  f. 2.8.2.1
  g. 2.8.2.2
  h. 2.8.3
  i. 2.8.4

If your platform/distribution is not currently listed above this does
not mean these shared objects won't work on your platform.  Numerous
Linux distributions share common libc versions and it is possible that
one of the above distributions and platforms will work on your system.
If none of the above combinations work on your platform, please send a
note to the snort-sigs mailing list so we can determine the need for
additional platforms and distributions to be added to the list of
supported platforms.

WARNING
-------
Sourcefire VRT rule packs often utilize enhancements made to Snort.
Operators should upgrade to the latest revision or patch level for Snort
to ensure these enhancements are available before using these rules.

USE
---
To use the shared object rules, the rule stub files must be generated.
To do this, follow these instructions:

 1. Make sure the dynamic preprocessor and dynamic engine paths are
    defined in snort.conf, for example:

 dynamicpreprocessor directory /usr/local/lib/snort_dynamicpreprocessor
 dynamicengine /usr/local/lib/snort_dynamicengine/libsf_engine.so

 2. Make sure the path to the location of the shared object rules is
    also defined in snort.conf, for example:

 dynamicdetection directory /usr/local/lib/snort_dynamicrule

 3. Dump the stub rules by issuing the command:

 snort -c /usr/local/etc/snort/snort.conf --dump-dynamic-rules=/usr/local/etc/snort/so_rules

 4. Use a variable to define the path to the stub rules, for example:

 var SO_RULE_PATH /usr/local/etc/snort/so_rules

 5. Include the generated stub rule files in snort.conf in the same way
    the regular rules are included, for example:

 include $SO_RULE_PATH/netbios.rules

 6. Test the installation by issuing the command:

 snort -c /usr/local/etc/snort/snort.conf -T
